# CustomBrowser
CustomBrowser is a lightweight Python-based browser interface inspired by Postman and web browsers. It focuses on HTTP requests/responses, HTTP status codes, and includes a cache management system. With it, users can view and delete cached data for specific URLs, making it a great educational tool for learning about HTTP caching and headers.
